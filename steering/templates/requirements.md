- [ ] Unit test: Verify loading state management
- [ ] Integration test: Verify UI responds to state changes
- [ ] Visual test: Verify spinner displays correctly

##### AC-1.3: [Error Handling Requirement]

**Pattern**: Unwanted Behavior (IF...THEN)

```
IF [error condition occurs], THEN the [System/Service] SHALL [error response]

IF validation fails, THEN the Form Service SHALL display error message "Please fill all required fields" and highlight invalid fields in red
```

**Test Verification**:

- [ ] Unit test: Verify error handling logic

---

##### AC-1.4: [Optional Feature Requirement]

**Pattern**: Optional Feature (WHERE)

```
WHERE [feature is enabled/configured], the [System/Service] SHALL [specific capability]
```

```

**Test Verification**:

- [ ] Unit test: Verify auto-save logic when enabled
- [ ] Integration test: Verify feature toggle works
- [ ] E2E test: Verify auto-save behavior end-to-end

**Example**:

```
The Form Service SHALL encrypt sensitive data using AES-256 before transmission
```

**Test Verification**:

- [ ] Unit test: Verify encryption is applied
- [ ] Security test: Verify encryption strength
- [ ] Integration test: Verify encrypted data transmission
