## Specification Driven Development Workflow

1. **Requirements** → `@requirements-analyst` → Define clear specifications
2. **Architecture** → `@system-architect` → Design scalable systems
3. **API Design** → `@api-designer` → Create REST/GraphQL APIs
4. **Implementation** → `@software-developer` → Write clean, tested code
5. **Quality** → `@code-reviewer` + `@test-engineer` → Ensure excellence
6. **Security** → `@security-auditor` → Verify protection
7. **Deployment** → `@devops-engineer` → Automate delivery

Or let the **Orchestrator** coordinate everything automatically!

## Usage

To use these agents in Claude Code, reference them in your conversations:

```
# Start with requirements
@requirements-analyst Create specifications for a task management system

# Or let Orchestrator handle the full workflow
@orchestrator Build a complete task management system from requirements to deployment

# Individual agent usage
@code-reviewer Please review this pull request
@test-engineer Create comprehensive tests for the auth module
@security-auditor Check for vulnerabilities in the API endpoints
```

## Customization

You can customize these agents by editing the markdown files in the `agents/` directory.
Add your project-specific guidelines, coding standards, and requirements.
